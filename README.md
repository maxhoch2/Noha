# Noha
Noha is a learing maschine. Developed by createplus.de

Our goal:
  * independent learning without a big code
  * userfriendly and modern
  * helpful... everytime

This program runs on a selfmade robot which has to learn and go on itself.
We give it a 6-axis arm, 4 menacum wheels, for orientation a Kinect/webcam and some Raspberry Pis.

The code name Noha deduce from the humanoide robot called NAO.

Have fun with our program and visit createplus.de!
